### Personal Info.

### Khaled Yamout

Born and raised in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia a city that was raised from the barren sands of the desert. Originally from Lebanon, enrolled at the Oxford multinational school where the first steps towards higher education began. Passionate about acting and film since childhood, after graduating from high school traveled to Lebanon to peruse an education in media studies at the Lebanese American University. In university learning so many skills and understanding progress in technology, observant that media in Lebanon was still in its most basic form. Graduated from (LAU) in 2014 to be able to continue studies abroad however, things did not go as planned. Obliged to stay, worked at an advertising company back in Riyadh where gaining work experience and profit took most of the focus from the real objective. Worked in different companies attaining a lot of knowledge and experience in how a business is run and what to expect from working in the media industry. After passing through many hardships, an understanding of what should happen next was initiating. Traveled back to Lebanon to begin work as a freelancer in media gave rise to time and new perspectives to work. After many attempts to finding a stable work environment, realized that in this country media was still in its most basic steps in becoming a proper industry with regard to global company standards. While having spare time, an interest in computers and technology begun. Learning the basics of what computers can do made it crucial to consider studying I.T. and all its aspects.

### Patrick Mugasa

My name is Patrick Mugasa, my student number is s3792796 and I’m a member of group 20 (Our name is Penta). I finished my high in 2012 and was admitted to study electrical engineering and computer science at the university of New South Wales (UNSW). I studied there for 2 years however, I did not finish my studies due to work commitment. During my studies I was introduced to a lot of IT fields from digital circuit design to programming in assemblies and other languages. I have some experience programming in different paradigms including functional and object oriented. I love programming as it helps me create some useful apps and among the languages I have learnt over the years include C, C#, Haskell, Java and Python. Recently, I decided to join RMIT to continue my studies in IT and I’m looking forward to finishing my studies. Studying at RMIT online helps me keep my job but study at the same time and this was the issue I had with my previous studies. My other interests in IT include networking and artificial intelligence. After finishing my degree in IT, I’m planning to be CCIE certified in both security and routing and switching. I’ve been told that CCIE is one of, if not the hardest exam in networking and I’m looking up to that challenge.  Apart from my academic life, I’m a bit introverted and love guitars. I’m currently learning how to play the guitar and my favorite artist is Erik Mongrain. When I’m not studying or working, I spend most of my time playing FIFA on my Xbox.

My name is Tayla Jean Surmon I am 24 years old. I was born and bred in Cairns, Far North Queensland. I completed my year 12 certificate at St Marys Catholic College in 2012. During my years at high school I had the burning desire to move into higher education and complete a degree in occupational once I completed my year 12 certificate, however I put that on hold took a gap year and unfortunately didn’t follow that desire, instead found happiness in working as a gymnastics coach (which I had already been doing since 2007) . My Mum was born in Sydney, however had the opportunity to travel far and wide as her dad was a plane engineer. My Dad is from Papua New Guinea and moved to Sydney Australia at the age of 6. I have 3 Older brothers all of which were born in Sydney. My first and only spoken language is English, however I would like to learn Japanese in the future. Between 2016 and the beginning of 2019 I worked as an insurance broker and gained my Tier 2 in General Insurance Broking. Currently I am working in a bank and in the process of completing my Tier 2 in Banking. I have a dog named Bruce and a cat named Mitsy who I absolutely adore. Up until 2013 I was a Gymnast/Trampolinist and extremely enjoyed it. My early retirement from Gymnastics/Trampolining came in 2013 when I decided that my knees and body was no longer able to take the harsh impact of the sport. 7 years later I decided it was time to jump back into full-time study and am now in the process of completing my Diploma of Business (Financial Planning).

### Saad Alvi

Name: Saad Alvi
Student ID: S3799294

Since a young age I have been in the workforce. Slowly becoming more experienced with my work I noticed that I would need to educate myself beyond a high school level. Many of my problems arise from trying to learn how to maintain the business, keeping up with the finances and making critical decisions. At this stage of my life I found that the best thing for me would be to do a Bachelors course in Financial Planning. This would be helping me directly in my work. I decided to go through my options as I have to go in to work from Monday to Friday even the weekends sometime. Working nine to five can be a lot of work and trying to go into class would be near impossible. So I decided to take up Open University. This would help me work and I would still be able to do my course. After finishing my course I feel as if I would have a lot more skill set to bring into my future problems. I will be able to help myself personally and career wise

## Ideal Jobs

Our ideal jobs have many similarities and differences nonetheless, it is crucial to know what they are to realize each other’s objective. There are so many functions a computer can produce though, it all differs on what, how, and which job requires a certain outcome. For instance Tayla has experience in accounting, Commerce/Banking, and consulting or advising. In her case she would need to use a computer to organize all her work and save financial data and client information. As mentioned earlier a computer not only helps organize workflow and save data but can function to create and produce works of art. Khaled a film student utilizes the computer to edit videos and so much more. Recently studying I.T. and computer sciences made him recognize that coding and programing can help him achieve things in design that were not discovered yet in his previous studies. Patrick who has an interest in Networking would use a computer in order to configure routers, troubleshooting any problems with the network, WAP’s, and help in many other ways to improve and make sure internet is accessible and smooth.  


## Group Accomplishment


As the group progressed further into the I.T. course, they all learned and researched all sorts of information to enable them to carry out the projects at hand. The research and the information gathered gave the individuals working on the projects new insight on technology and to understand the potentials of each topic that was covered. The group was able to communicate and convey their ideas to one another using social media and other means of communications. Once communications were set up they all decided on dividing work-load equally and fairly so that everyone did the same amount of work and contributed to the project together. The main objective of the previous project was not only to research and gather information but, also to create an ideas for a new project that had potential of becoming a tangible and realistic assignment. After submission of the project the group had a chance on reflecting on group performance which would help everyone know their faults and allow them to improve as the individuals advanced further into the future projects to come.

## Plan for Group Project

PENTA is a well rounded group, with each individual having their own unique skills and experiences. If the group manages to put those skills together, they would be able to gather and create a project that would have a lot of great aspects that would be needed to make a project successful. The I.T. industry is a vast and expanding subject, there are so many things to work on and yet, it is a very challenging field to work on.

There are so many trends these days to work with but which trend would be the best choice to add or invest in? The answer would revolve around what the objective the project is moving towards. Some of the best trends are examples like; Mixed reality, A.I., IoT, Progressive web, Blockchains, and etc.  James R. (2019, 04, 25) 10 Software Development Trends in 2019. Retrieved from https://hackernoon.com/10-top-software-development-trends-a12d25f5fd2d.

A career plan needs to be carefully studied and prepped for. A project that needs to be developed would have to have a foundation to work on. A state would be knowing what the project is to begin with. Is it an app that would bring services to the people? Is it something that would be available on a website? Or is it an internal software for a company that would make work easier? A career plan needs to have the proper funding and most of all, people willing to go through with the project till the end even if it fails at first, because failure brings you closer to success.
The first assignments the group has worked on allowed the members of PENTA to understand the concept of team work and communications. Learning how to cooperate with one another was an important step to take in order to get work done.   


### Overview Topic

The proposed project is an idea that was developed from the last assignment. It was first thought of as a way to prevent drug addiction of prescribed medicine to people that are desperate. It then grew into being something more than just preventing them but, rather a way to assist citizens back to normal health. The outcomes of the project would not only be about preventing addicts from making their condition worse but it would give them another chance at becoming a part of society and going back to living good healthy lives.

After having the citizens rehabilitated, the program would keep a careful watch on their progress as they are released back into society. It not only stops them from going back to their addictions but it predicts their actions and will allow the intervention of the government before the citizen relapses into addiction.      

### Motivation

The motivation of the project is based solely on people’s health before anything. So many people have had their lives torn apart from being addicts and the rate is increasing in many places not just Australia. The project is important because if done correctly it can really have an impact on the lives of the people who are going through very though periods. It fits with I.T. trends as the program is live, meaning everything that is happening is being updated 24/7 automatically checking the progress of individuals and their medications. If the project were to actually launch there would be a significant change in how pharmacies all over the world operate. Understanding the importance of the project should allow an employer know that this project is crucial in the fight for keeping people from becoming addicts and getting them the proper help and support if they are.        

### Landscape

There is a program that is similar in the sense that it tracks one’s prescription in a safe manner however, the program/app that the group is trying to create is actually quite unique. As for competition, there are no real rivals since the app or program would be the first of its kind. The only hard part is getting pharmaceuticals to actually use the program properly as they depend on people’s desperate need for prescriptions in order to make more profit. What truly makes the program unique is the affiliation of the government and how the program keeps live tracking of the addicts to help bring them back to health.       

Detailed Description of Project 

Devided into sections below.

### Aims

### Plans and Progress

### Roles

### Scope and Limits

Before developing the project, we plan to implement a prototype at a small scale to see its effectiveness and efficiency before committing to the project. We will employ a small group of software developers that will develop the application at a small scale. The application will be developed and deployed on a local machine with a small database containing the records of patients. The database will be small enough that we won’t be worried about performance. After developing the prototype, we will ask the developers to create test simulations to check its performance. We will then propose our idea to the local council and if we succeed, we will give it to the council to track prescription drug abusers. At this stage however, we will have limited access to the database that runs the application since it will be containing private information of the patients. If the app fails at this stage, we will ask the developers to improve it until its functional and if it succeeds, we will upscale it to the state level. The main problem that we will face during the upscaling is the hardware resources that will be needed. One of the solutions that we suggested was to use a cloud based system which allows upscaling and downscaling easy. The other solution was to build a server center but it would be costly in terms of construction and maintenance. Another issue with upscaling is the slow performance due to large data sets. To solve this problem, we intend to hire a computer scientist who is skilled in searching and sorting algorithms to optimize the performance of the app. We will keep upscaling it until it reaches the national level where it will track every patient and their usage of prescription drugs.
