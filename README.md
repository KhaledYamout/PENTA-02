## Ideal Jobs

Our ideal jobs have many similarities and differences nonetheless, it is crucial to know what they are to realize each other’s objective. There are so many functions a computer can produce though, it all differs on what, how, and which job requires a certain outcome. For instance Tayla has experience in accounting, Commerce/Banking, and consulting or advising. In her case she would need to use a computer to organize all her work and save financial data and client information. As mentioned earlier a computer not only helps organize workflow and save data but can function to create and produce works of art. Khaled a film student utilizes the computer to edit videos and so much more. Recently studying I.T. and computer sciences made him recognize that coding and programing can help him achieve things in design that were not discovered yet in his previous studies. Patrick who has an interest in Networking would use a computer in order to configure routers, troubleshooting any problems with the network, WAP’s, and help in many other ways to improve and make sure internet is accessible and smooth.  


## Group Accomplishment


As the group progressed further into the I.T. course, they all learned and researched all sorts of information to enable them to carry out the projects at hand. The research and the information gathered gave the individuals working on the projects new insight on technology and to understand the potentials of each topic that was covered. The group was able to communicate and convey their ideas to one another using social media and other means of communications. Once communications were set up they all decided on dividing work-load equally and fairly so that everyone did the same amount of work and contributed to the project together. The main objective of the previous project was not only to research and gather information but, also to create an ideas for a new project that had potential of becoming a tangible and realistic assignment. After submission of the project the group had a chance on reflecting on group performance which would help everyone know their faults and allow them to improve as the individuals advanced further into the future projects to come.

## Plan for Group Project

PENTA is a well rounded group, with each individual having their own unique skills and experiences. If the group manages to put those skills together, they would be able to gather and create a project that would have a lot of great aspects that would be needed to make a project successful. The I.T. industry is a vast and expanding subject, there are so many things to work on and yet, it is a very challenging field to work on.

There are so many trends these days to work with but which trend would be the best choice to add or invest in? The answer would revolve around what the objective the project is moving towards. Some of the best trends are examples like; Mixed reality, A.I., IoT, Progressive web, Blockchains, and etc.  James R. (2019, 04, 25) 10 Software Development Trends in 2019. Retrieved from https://hackernoon.com/10-top-software-development-trends-a12d25f5fd2d.

A career plan needs to be carefully studied and prepped for. A project that needs to be developed would have to have a foundation to work on. A state would be knowing what the project is to begin with. Is it an app that would bring services to the people? Is it something that would be available on a website? Or is it an internal software for a company that would make work easier? A career plan needs to have the proper funding and most of the people willing to go through with the project till the end even if it fails at first, because failure brings you closer to success.
The first assignments the group has worked on allowed the members of PENTA to understand the concept of team work and communications. Learning how to cooperate with one another was an important step to take in order to get work done.   


### Overview Topic

The proposed project is an idea that was developed from the last assignment. It was first thought of as a way to prevent drug addiction of prescribed medicine to people that are desperate. It then grew into being something more than just preventing them but, rather a way to assist citizens back to normal health. The outcomes of the project would not only be about preventing addicts from making their condition worse but it would give them another chance at becoming a part of society and going back to living good healthy lives.

After having the citizens rehabilitated, the program would keep a careful watch on their progress as they are released back into society. It not only stops them from going back to their addictions but it predicts their actions and will allow the intervention of the government before the citizen relapses into addiction.      

### Motivation

The motivation of the project is based solely on people’s health before anything. So many people have had their lives torn apart from being addicts and the rate is increasing in many places not just Australia. The project is important because if done correctly it can really have an impact on the lives of the people who are going through very through periods. It fits with I.T. trends as the program is live, meaning everything that is happening is being updated 24/7 automatically checking the progress of individuals and their medications. If the project were to actually launch there would be a significant change in how pharmacies all over the world operate. Understanding the importance of the project should allow an employer know that this project is crucial in the fight for keeping people from becoming addicts and getting them the proper help and support if they are.
